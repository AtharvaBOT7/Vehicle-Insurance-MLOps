In this file, I have written the order in which I have executed the project.

Steps:
1. Create project template by executing the template.py file. In the template file we usually have the project's folder and file structure.
2. Write the code on setup.py and project.toml file to import the local packages.
3. Create virtual env, activate and install the install the requirements from requirements.txt (In this project we will use Python version 3.10)
4. Check if all the packages have been installed properly.
